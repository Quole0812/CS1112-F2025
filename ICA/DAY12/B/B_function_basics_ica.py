#CS 1112
# Learning Python (Python version: 3)
# Module 2: Functions Fundamentals ACTIVITY

## For each exercise, create a function that accomplishes
## what is described in the requirements

## Function signatures along with the docstring documentation
## are provided for each task!
# (A Python docstring is a string literal used to document a Python
# module, class, function or method, helping programmers
# understand functionality without reading implementation details)

## IMPORTANT: use the Python keyword 'return' followed by the value
##            you want to return (function output) rather than
##            printing the result.

# EXERCISE #1:
# Write a function that computes the area of a triangle

def calculate_triangle_area(base, height):
    # the calculation (Area = 1/2 * base * height)
    '''
    Function to compute the area of a triangle
    :param base: measurement of the base of the triangle
    :param height: measurement of the height of the triangle
    :return: the area of the triangle, calculated using base and height
    '''
    # Write the function body here!


# EXERCISE #2:
# Write a function to determine if a number is positive or negative

def check_positive_negative(num):
    '''
    Function that determines if a given number is positive or negative
    :param num: the number to be evaluated
    :return: a string, "Positive" or "Negative", based on the sign of the number
    '''
    # Write the function body here!


# EXERCISE 3:
# Write a function to determine if a year is a leap year
'''
Note:  Leap years are years divisible by 4, except for century years
       which must be divisible by 400 to be leap years.

       *Century years - 1900, 2000, 2100, etc.
'''


# Note: multiple correct approaches exist for solving this problem!

def check_leap_year(year):
    '''
    A function that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not
    :param year: the year to be evaluated
    :return: a Boolean value, True or False, indicating if the given year is a leap year (True) or not (False)
