# CS 1112
# Learning Python (Python version: 3)
# Module 2: Functions Basics ACTIVITY

## For each activity, write a function that accomplishes
## what is stated in the description

## Function definitions along with the docstring comment header
## is provided for each!
# (A Python docstring is a string used to document a Python
# module, class, function or method, so programmers can
# understand what it does without having to read the details
# of the implementation)

## REMEMBER: use the Python key word 'return' followed by the thing
##           you want to return (output of the function) instead of
##           printing the result.

# ACTIVITY #1:
# Write a function that calculates the perimeter of a rectangle

def calculate_rectangle_perimeter(length, width):
    '''
    Function to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle
    :param length: measurement of the length of the rectangle
    :param width:  measurement of the width of the rectangle
    :return: the perimeter of the rectangle, calculated using length and width
    '''
    # Write the body of the function here!


# ACTIVITY #2:
# Write a function to check if a number is even or odd

def check_even_odd(number):
    '''
    Function that checks if a given number is even or odd
    :param number: the number to be checked
    :return: a string, "Even" or "Odd", depending on if the number is even or odd
    '''
    # Write the body of the function here!


# ACTIVITY 3:
# Write a function to check if a year is a leap year
'''
Note:  Leap years are non-end-of-century years that are divisible by 4,
       or end-of-century-year that are divisible by 400.

       *End of century years - 2000, 3000, etc.
'''


# Note: there are many possible ways to write a correct solution for this problem!

def is_leap_year(year):
    '''
    A function that determines if a given year is a leap year or not
    :param year: the year to be checked
    :return: a Boolean, True or False, determining if the given year is a leap year (True) or not (False)
    '''
    # Write the body of the function here!
