# Learning Python (Python version: 3)
# Module 2: Booleans and Conditionals ACTIVITY


# CONDITIONAL ACTIVITY
# Write code using conditionals that converts a numerical grade
# to its corresponding GPA value. (E.g. if grade = 88, return 3.3)

# Grade Scale:
# 97-100 = A+ = 4.0
# 93-96  = A  = 4.0
# 90-92  = A- = 3.7
# 87-89  = B+ = 3.3
# 83-86  = B  = 3.0
# 80-82  = B- = 2.7
# 77-79  = C+ = 2.3
# 73-76  = C  = 2.0
# 70-72  = C- = 1.7
# 65-69  = D+ = 1.3
# 60-64  = D  = 1.0
# Below 60 = F = 0.0

# @@@@@
# BONUS CHALLENGE:
#       Create a *function* named convert_to_gpa that takes a
#       numerical grade as input and returns the corresponding GPA.
#       Function signature: def convert_to_gpa(numerical_grade):
#       Remember to use conditionals inside your function!
# @@@@@


# Tip: Consider using if...elif...elif...else structure for your conditionals

'''
#~Provided you enter these percentages, this is what the output should be~#
If percentage is 87: 3.3 GPA
If percentage is 92: 3.7 GPA
If percentage is 61: 0.7 GPA
If percentage is 76: 2.0 GPA
If percentage is 50: 0.0 GPA
If percentage is 99: 4.0 GPA
