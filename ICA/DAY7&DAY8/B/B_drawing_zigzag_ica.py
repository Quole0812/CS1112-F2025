# Learning Python (Python version: 3)
# Module 1: Turtle with conditionals ACTIVITY

### Create a turtle that draws a zig-zag line.
### THE APPROACH WE WISH YOU TO TAKE IS AS FOLLOWS:
###   - CREATE A FOR-LOOP THAT GOES THROUGH NUMBERS 1 THROUGH 10
###   - IF THE CURRENT NUMBER IS EVEN, MOVE FORWARD 45 PIXELS
###     AND PIVOT RIGHT BY 45 DEGREES
###   - IF THE CURRENT NUMBER IS ODD, MOVE FORWARD 45 PIXELS
###     AND PIVOT *LEFT* BY 45 DEGREES

### FEEL FREE TO BE CREATIVE IN ANY OTHER WAY WITH RESPECT
### TO COLORS AND PENWIDTH, ETC.

### BE SURE TO CHECK-IN WITH A TA BEFORE YOU LEAVE CLASS TODAY.
