## PA00: Fix It Up!

**Due by: 11:00pm on Wednesday, January 29, 2025**

**Objective:** The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to the PyCharm IDE and fundamentals of basic programming. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to understand and implement variables, type casting, arithmetic operations, printing, and commenting.

[instruction](/cs1112basit/instruction/PA_00___Fix_it_Up_.pdf)
[Starter Code](../../Starter%20Code%20For%20Homework/fix_it_up.py)
## 1 Task

1. The Python file, called fix it up.py, for this assignment can be found on Canvas.
Look under “Assignments” on Canvas to find PA00, the first programming assignment
(PA). Download the Python file (.py) and open it into PyCharm as discussed in class.
The PDF file (this file that you are reading) provides the instructions for the current
programming assignment.
2. There are 7 “questions” in the fix it up.py file provided for this assignment.
3. Complete each question as directed by the comments in the file (make sure to read
all comments for each question carefully!) All of your answers are to be typed
directly into the existing fix it up.py Python file (using PyCharm) - do not submit
any other kind of file

*Remember to comment your code, so that you and those reading your code can understand its functionalities*

## 2 Submission and Collaboration Policy

### 2.1 Your Submission–Comment Header

Your `.py` file should contain the following information (header) at the top of your file:
```py
# NAME: e.g. I. Lv. Sneks
# COMPUTING ID: e.g. ils3py@virginia.edu
# PA NUMBER and NAME: e.g. PA## - Name of the Assignment
# Resources used (if applicable):
```

For Resources, include URLs to any online resources where you studied or reviewed code that is specific to these problems, including any physical textbooks you referenced. Include any other resources you used here. Note on resources: Please feel free to refer to the lecture slides, demos, and in-class labs to complete this assignment (all located on Canvas).

Absolutely no collaboration with any fellow students (who are not current CS 1112 course TAs) is allowed. Your work must represent individual effort. You must write your own code: not just type it, but also compose it yourself as your own original work.

You must cite any and every source you consult, other than those explicitly provided by the course itself. If you work with, obtain or receive help from another source (Internet website, textbook, TA, tutor, online video, etc.), nothing should be copied or retyped into the submitted solution. References must be documented in a comment in the code on the assignment. Any copied work is an Honor Code violation.

### 2.2 Gradescope

#### 2.2.1 Submitting on Gradescope

1. Go to Gradescope (linked in Canvas course website)
2. Click on PA00 – Fix It Up! in the assignment list on Gradescope
3. Ensure the file you are submitting is named `fix_it_up.py` (please do not name your file anything else!)
4. Upload your `.py` file by clicking in the box of the upload submission method to browse your files (select your `.py` file), then submit!
5. Remember to include your name, computing ID, and resources in the comments (see Section 2.1)!!

You should submit your code to Gradescope. If you are having trouble with your submission, you should double check the following common problems:

1. Make sure you are only submitting one (1) file, and it is called `fix_it_up.py` exactly
2. Make sure your functions do not print anything, unless otherwise specified. If you do print anything, it must be printed to the screen

*This assignment will be graded by hand, and therefore will not have a Gradescope autograder. That is, you will not see a score as soon as you submit. To enable your assignment to be graded as fast as possible, please make sure your answers are in the format each individual question specifies and are clear for TAs to grade.*

Note: If you face any further difficulties or have questions, please reach out to the instructor or teaching assistants for assistance.
