# sort_grades
# Create a Python function named sort_grades() that takes a list of student grades (integer values) as its argument.
# 1) Inside the function, use the sorted() function to create a sorted list from the grades.
# 2) After sorting, find and display the highest and lowest grades in the list. (Hint: where in the list will they be?)

# In order to run and test your code, do the following:
# 1) Create a list of student grades with at least five integer values.
#      (For example:   student_grades = [88, 72, 94, 65, 78, 91, 83]        feel free to use this below if you like)
#
# 2) Call the sort_grades function with the list as an argument to sort and display the highest and lowest grades.


# Extra activity:
# Find and display the second-highest grade in the list.


# Function to sort and analyze student grades

# WRITE YOUR SOLUTION HERE:

def sort_grades(grades):




# TEST YOUR CODE HERE!
# List of student grades
# Create a list of student grades with at least five integer values:


# Call the function to sort and analyze grades - Pass in your list of grades as the argument:



## ********************
# To think about and possibly add to your code:
# What if you are given an empty list? For example:
empty_grades = []  # Nothing in the list
# Call the function
sort_grades(empty_grades)  # What do you put in your code to print something like "No grades to analyze." ??
