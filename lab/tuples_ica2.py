# CS 1112
# Learning Python (Python version: 3)
# Module 5: Tuples Activity

# Write a function named find_common_elements
# This function should find the common elements between two tuples
# Returns a tuple of common elements between the two tuples

# WRITE YOUR SOLUTION HERE:
def find_common_elements(tuple1, tuple2):






## TESTING YOUR CODE:
# Two tuples with elements
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
tuple2 = (3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

# Call the function to find common elements
common_elements = find_common_elements(tuple1, tuple2)

# Display the common elements
if common_elements:
    print("Common elements:", common_elements)
else:
    print("No common elements found.")
