# Learning Python (Python version: 3)
# Module 2: Conditionals ACTIVITY

'''
ACTIVITY:
Use conditionals along with turtle functions to create a small program
that does the following:

1) Prompt (ask) the user to select one of four options:
  What would you like the turtle to draw? (Or select 4 to exit)
        1) Circle
        2) Hexagon
        3) Octagon
        4) EXIT

  (Note: if the user selects 4, the program ends, and nothing is drawn to the screen.
  You can output a "goodbye" message to the screen if you wish, e.g., "Exiting program!")

2) Use if-statements and conditionals in your code to draw one of the diagrams
   (options 1, 2, or 3) or exit (option 4)

3) Once a selection is made and after the drawing is complete, if applicable, then end the program.

# WRITE YOUR SOLUTION BELOW:
# Some code has been written to get you started.
import turtle

darrell = turtle.Turtle()  # Feel free to change the name of your turtle (and any other attributes) if you'd like
darrell.shape('turtle')
darrell.pencolor('green')
darrell.pensize(4)















turtle.done()
