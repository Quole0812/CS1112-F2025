# CS 1112
# Learning Python (Python version: 3)
# Module 2: Booleans and Conditionals ACTIVITY


# CONDITIONAL ACTIVITY
# Use conditionals to write some code that converts and returns
# the GPA when given a percentage. (E.g. if percentage = 95, return 4.0)

# 94-100 = A = 4.0
# 90-93 = A- = 3.7
# 87-89 = B+ = 3.3
# 83-86 = B = 3.0
# 80-82 = B- = 2.7
# 77-79 = C+ = 2.3
# 73-76 = C = 2.0
# 70-72 = C- = 1.7
# 67-69 = D+ = 1.3
# 63-67 = D = 1.0
# 60-62 = D- = 0.7
# 0-59 = F = 0.0

# @@@@@
# Want a challenge?
#       Write a *function* called gpa_calc that converts and
#       returns the GPA when given a percentage.
#       Use this function definition:  def gpa_calc(percent):
#       You will still use conditionals inside this function.
# @@@@@


# Hint: For conditionals think about the if...elif...elif...else structure
# WRITE YOUR PYTHON SOLUTION BELOW: (regular or challenge version)





















### TESTING ### ~~ Be sure to test your code out!
'''
#~Provided you enter these percentages, this is what the output should be~#
If percentage is 87: 3.3 GPA
If percentage is 92: 3.7 GPA
If percentage is 61: 0.7 GPA
If percentage is 76: 2.0 GPA
If percentage is 50: 0.0 GPA
If percentage is 99: 4.0 GPA
